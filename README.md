# Battleship Game

Welcome to the Battleship Game project! This is a simple implementation of the classic game Battleship in Python, where you can play against an AI enemy. The game is designed to be a learning project for those looking to practice their Python programming skills.

## Game Overview

In Battleship, you will have a game board with hidden boats. Your objective is to guess the locations of the enemy's boats and sink them before the enemy sinks yours. Each boat occupies a certain number of spaces on the board.

## Features

- Random placement of boats for both the player and the AI enemy.
- A user-friendly interface in the console.
- The ability to see your previous guesses and hits/misses.
- A simple AI enemy that makes random guesses.

## Setup

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download it from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file and extract it.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's directory.

4. Run the game by executing the following command: (python3 run.py) in the console 
   
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## How to Play

1. You will be prompted to enter your guess in the format of "A5" (row first, then column).

2. The game will inform you if your guess was a hit or a miss, and if you have sunk any enemy boats.

3. Continue taking turns with the AI enemy until either you or the enemy sinks all the boats.

4. The game will end, and the winner (you or the AI enemy) will be announced.

## Project Structure

- `run.py`: The main Python script that contains the game logic.
